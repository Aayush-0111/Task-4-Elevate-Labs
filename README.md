# Task-4-Elevate-Labs
# Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates binary classification using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer dataset from `scikit-learn`. It includes model training, evaluation, threshold tuning, and visualization using ROC curves.

## Features

- Uses Breast Cancer dataset (binary target: malignant or benign)
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Standardizes input features
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluates the model using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision and Recall
  - ROC-AUC Score and ROC Curve
- Allows manual tuning of classification threshold

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
